## E-commerce Web API 🚀
Wasup!
This project stems from my drive to go a step beyond university coursework, building with modern technologies and developing a scalable solution that aligns current market demands.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Develop an end-to-end RESTful API to manage an e-commerce system, applying professional design patterns and ensuring data integrity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C#

* **Framework:** .NET 8 (Web API)

* **Database:** SQL Server

* **ORM:** Entity Framework Core

* **Containerization:** Docker

* **Security:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) [In progress]

* **Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI

## 🏗️ Architecture & Best Practices
For this development, I chose a clean and maintainable architecture:

* **Repository Pattern & Interfaces:** Decoupling business logic from data access to facilitate maintenance and future testing.

* **DTOs & AutoMapper:** Implementation of Data Transfer Objects to protect domain entities and optimize the API’s public exposure.

* **Naming Conventions:** Industry standards for Primary Keys (Id) and Foreign Keys (EntityId).
